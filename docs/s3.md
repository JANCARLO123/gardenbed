# S3 credentials

## Creating your keys

- Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
- Create a group
- Create a user - this is what your credentials will be associated with
- Click on that user and then click on permissions
- Attach a policy of `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- Click on the `Security Credentials` tab and click on `Create Access Key`
- Download your credentials - you'll need to add these to your `common.yaml`

## Creating your bucket

- Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
- Create a bucket that you want to use for your backups
- Click on `properties` in the top right corner
- Click on `permissions` and add yourself

## Create a GPG passphrase

To make sure that your backups are encrypted before they're stored on S3,
you can add a passphrase to your `common.yaml`.
This step is optional, but recommended.
Be sure to keep a copy of this that's not on your server.
Otherwise, if your server gets corrupted, you'll no longer be able to
make use of the backups that you have on S3.

## Adding your configurations to gardenbed

Once you've finished these steps, add them to the commented sections
in your `common.yaml`.
